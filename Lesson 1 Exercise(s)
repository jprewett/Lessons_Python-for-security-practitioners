PART 1

Install Python (see https://www.python.org/)


PART 2

Install PyCharm Community Edition (see https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)
NOTE: PyCharm is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) purpose built for Python.  
      Although Part 1 (above) is all that's absolutely needed for writing and practicing Python, 
      IDEs (in general) are worthwhile because they offer additional features such as code editing, 
      debugging, syntax highlighting, project management, and version control.
