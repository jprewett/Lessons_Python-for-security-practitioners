1. Create five well-named variables/memory locations of the type string.  To each variable, assign one of the following strings: Critical, High, Medium, Low, and Informational
2. Create a well-named variable/memory location of the type float and assign any number between 0.0 and 10.0
3. If the float is between the range 9.0 to 10.0, print Critical
4. If the float is between the range 7.0 to 8.9, print High
5. If the float is between the range 4.0 to 6.9, print Medium
6. If the float is between the range 0.1 to 3.9, print Low
7. If the float is 0.0, print Informational
