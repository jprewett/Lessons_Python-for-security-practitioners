PART 1

- Create the following variables and their assignments:

prefix = 'CVE'
delimiter = '-'
year = '2025'
identifier = '21333'

- Concatenate all the above variables and assign the result into a final variable name cve where the final result is CVE-2025-21333
- Print the result
- Print the resulting data type


PART 2

- Remove the quotation marks from 2025 and/or 21333.
- Via the simple process of removing the quotation marks, what data type is created?
- Try concatenation with the new data type.  What happens?  Why?


PART 3

- The following code block is flawed (i.e., it will successfully execute, but the result is mathematically inaccurate).  Apply PEMDAS principles to correct the code and print an accurate result. 

first_cvss_score = 9.2
second_cvss_score = 8.8
third_cvss_score = 7.3
average_cvss_score = first_cvss_score + second_cvss_score + third_cvss_score / 3
print(average_cvss_score)


PART 4

- When corrected, the above code block prints a float data type with multiple digits following the decimal point.
- However, following CVSS scoring methodology, only one digit should follow the decimal point.  
- Research Python's round() method and apply it to the above code block so that only one digit remains after the decimal point.
